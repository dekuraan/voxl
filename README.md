    <br><br>
    A 3D game engine specialized for voxel-type worlds.
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Data driven</h2>
    <p>Voxl uses an Entity-Component-System architecture from legion, working along with rust's safety and concurrency features for preventing invalidating states.</p>
    <br>
  <h2>Fast Render</h2>
  <p>The render engine is built on top of wgpu-rs ensuring optimal drawing capabilities, theoretically more performant than opengl.</p>
